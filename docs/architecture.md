# System Architecture

## Agent Orchestration System

The platform uses a distributed agent architecture with the following key components:

### Core System Components

1. Agent Orchestrator
   - Manages agent lifecycle
   - Handles task distribution
   - Monitors system health
   - Manages inter-agent communication

2. Task Queue System
   - Priority-based task scheduling
   - Task dependency management
   - Load balancing
   - Failure recovery

3. Communication Protocol
   - Event-driven messaging
   - Real-time updates
   - State synchronization
   - Error handling

### Data Flow
```
User Request -> Task Queue -> Agent Orchestrator -> Specialized Agent -> Result Aggregation -> Response
```

### Scaling Strategy
Each agent type can be independently scaled based on demand. The orchestrator automatically manages agent instances and workload distribution.
